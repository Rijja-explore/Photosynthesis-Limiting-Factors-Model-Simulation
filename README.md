# Photosynthesis Limiting Factors Model Simulation

## Overview
This project is a 3D interactive simulation of plant growth and photosynthesis, visualizing how environmental factors affect plant health. Built with React, Three.js, and React Three Fiber, it features a realistic GLTF plant model, dynamic status indicators, and user controls for environmental scenarios.

## Features
- 3D plant visualization using GLTF model
- Real-time growth and stress simulation
- Environmental controls (light, CO₂, temperature)
- Status and growth indicators
- Zoom and rotation controls
- Responsive UI overlays

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd Photosynthesis-Limiting-Factors-Model-Simulation
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
- Adjust environmental controls to see real-time changes in plant growth and stress.
- View status and growth indicators at the bottom of the 3D viewport.
- Zoom and rotate the plant for detailed inspection.

## Project Structure
- `src/components/` - React components for UI and 3D visualization
- `src/utils/` - Biology engine and helper functions
- `public/models/` - GLTF plant model assets
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies (if backend/data analysis is added)
- `package.json` - Main project dependencies

## Requirements
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm
- Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

## Optional Python Backend
If you add a Python backend for data analysis, list dependencies in `requirements.txt` and run with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
